I don't know whether I like cooking or just eating the resulting food.
In any case, there are quite a few recipes to which I have taken a liking.
These come from various sources, be it the internet, cooking books, or just "secret knowledge"
passed down the family tree.
In many cases, I have also adapted them to either my own preferences or the demands of my family.
The resulting recipes can be found here.
